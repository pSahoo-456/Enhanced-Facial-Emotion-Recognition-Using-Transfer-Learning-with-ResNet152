# **Emotion Recognition Using Transfer Learning with ResNet152**

## 📜 **Project Overview**
This project leverages **Transfer Learning** using the **ResNet152 architecture** to classify facial emotions from images into six categories:
- **Ahegao**
- **Angry**
- **Happy**
- **Neutral**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**

With robust preprocessing and data augmentation techniques, the model achieves high accuracy in recognizing emotions, making it suitable for real-world applications such as sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and user experience enhancement.
